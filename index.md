## Summary

I am currently a third year `Data science` and `AI` student. Out of all the technical abilities I have learned during my higher education, the one I value most is the ability of **tackling problems I have never seen before**. I might not find the solution, but i am definitely not going to stand by idly!

## Projects

- ### Fair Feedback Systems for Academic Assessment using LLMs
We performed a project together with Dutch company [Ans](https://ans.app/landing) in which we aimed to help teachers grade exams by assesing how well a student's answer matched the rubric criteria for that question. We tried several state-of-the-art Large Language Models (*LLM's*) for this task such as [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert), [LLama2](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2), [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/), [GPT-3.5](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates) and evaluated them on *The Stanford Question Answering Dataset* ([SQUAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)). The final product was displayed on a simple GUI that can be seen below:

We made a (non-published) paper about it and can be downloaded here:

- ### Sentiment Analysis of inmates Last Statements using Natural language processing (NLP)
We performed a study to analyze the Last Statements from Inmates executed in texas since 1984 using NLP techniques and models such as `BERT` or N-Gram frequency analysis. The data is publicly available and can be seen [here](https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html). A wordcloud of the last statements can be seen below.
