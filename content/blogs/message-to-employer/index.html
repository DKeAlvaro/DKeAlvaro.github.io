            <h1>A message to my future employer</h1>
            
            <p>I recently finished my <strong>BSc in Data Science and Artificial intelligence</strong> from Maastricht university (#1 AI degree in The Netherlands).</p>

            <p>Since then, I have been working as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> for the Dutch company <strong><a href="https://www.sqippa.com/en/">Sqippa</a></strong>, in which I developed from the ground up a full stack web application which allowed users to create their own schedules for IOT devices, including Authentication, API endpoints/requests and web deployment. (See screenshots below)</p>

            <div class="image-grid" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
                <figure style="flex: 1; margin-right: 10px;">
                    <img src="/content/blogs/message-to-employer/image.png" alt="Sqippa Screenshot 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                </figure>
                <figure style="flex: 1; margin-left: 10px;">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>And this is not even my speciality! This project involved too much web development, which is not exactly what I am looking for to work in the future, so I decided to leave this project.</p>

            <p>Apart from this project, I have been working on many side projects during these months, which I will explain in cronological order:</p>

            <h2>DailyClips</h2>
            <div class="project-section" style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
                <div class="project-description" style="flex: 1; margin-right: 10px;">
                    <p><a href="https://www.dailyclips.es">DailyClips</a> was born with the idea that learning english is better via the <a href="https://www.mimicmethod.com/the-method/">mimic method</a> (it basically states that a good way to learn is by hearing and repeating).</p>
                    <p>The app shows users 5 different movie clips every day and allows them to repeat what they heard, and get scored by a speech to text model.</p>
                    <p>Although the app hasn't gotten many traction, I will continue improving it as I believe is a really helpful tool.</p>
                </div>
                <figure style="flex: 1;">
                    <img src="/content/blogs/message-to-employer/image 2.png" alt="DailyClips Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <style>
                @media (max-width: 768px) {
                    .project-section {
                        flex-direction: column !important;
                    }
                    .project-description {
                        margin-right: 0 !important;
                        width: 100% !important;
                    }
                    .project-section figure {
                        flex: none !important;
                        width: 100% !important;
                        margin-top: 1rem;
                    }
                }
            </style>

            <h2>GPT-Primavera</h2>
            <p>I wanted to see how well gpt models would perform on a set of math exams I used to participate in when I was a child: "Concurso de Primavera de Matemáticas".</p>
            <p>These are fixed length 25 multiple choice question exams (5 options per question) that follow the IMO spirit aimed to children aged 10-18.</p>
            <p>It turned out that, gpt4o vision model was always outperformed by the average student…</p>

            <h2>Inditex Data Science Hackathon</h2>
            <p>The hackathon was a 2 month long competition focused on making a recommendation system for a given e-commerce, in which I finally scored 17th out of 1211 competitors. In this hackathon, many participants were professional Data scientists, which made me realize I can compete even with the top professionals.</p>

            <h2>DumbGPT</h2>
            <p>Large Language Models like chatGPT have been all over the place since 2022, but few people really know how they work. Thats why I decided to learn about them following <strong>Andrej Karpathy's</strong> <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT">minGPT repository</a>, which is the simplest implementation of GPT models.</p>
            <p>However, I still found his repository to be too complex, therefore I created <a href="https://github.com/DKeAlvaro/dumbGPT">dumbGPT</a>, which explains a full walkthrough of a GPT model from data processing until model inference.</p>
            <p>To show it works, I applied it to a casino game and you can see the results here (In spanish):</p>

            <h2>Agent2Bench</h2>
            <p>Agent2Bench is a proposed benchmark that tests LLMs abilities in daily life computer tasks like booking flights, downloading programs or exiting vim. A demo can be found <a href="https://dkealvaro.github.io/Agent2Bench/">here</a></p>

            <h2>Jupyter Style CV Generator</h2>
            <p>A simple web application that generates CVs in the style of Jupyter Notebooks (See example below). Code <a href="https://github.com/DKeAlvaro/Jupyter-Style-CV-Generator">here</a>

            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            <p>After working on all of these projects, I gained quite a lot of valuable knowledge, especially in the following aspects:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Technical</h3>
                    <p>For example, when starting to develop the application for Sqippa, a Senior Developer taught me how to use a browser's developer tools in order to understand how the API calls are made and reverse engineer most of the websites. That was extremely useful for the GPT-Primavera project, as instead of manually downloading the exams and solutions one by one (There were around 100 files to download) I managed to download them via code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Shifted my mentality to: "Results > Process"</h3>
                    <p>During university we always had projects, however back then I was missing this critical way of thinking of: "Am I focusing on the right thing within this project?". For example: during my second year in university, we had to develop a chatbot. We had a project manual, and I remember I spent almost all the time working on the spellchecker functionality, rather than creating a cool, usable product!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Marketing and sales</h3>
                    <p>Six months ago, I posted this on linkedin:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"I hate unnecessary jargon & occasional fakeness on LinkedIn. I'm just waiting to have a career that speaks for itself so my LinkedIn can look like this:"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="/content/blogs/message-to-employer/22b1cc19-4790-4547-8bdd-745dd391399c.png" alt="LinkedIn Post" style="max-width:300px; height: auto;">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Even though I greatly have to improve this aspect, I learned that, unless you are a complete genius who doesn't need to sell themselves (and even then) it is very beneficial that you know how to sell yourself to others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Knowing what I want and what I don't want</h3>
                    <p>Before finishing my degree, as most people I started actively searching for a job. I would spend hours and hours applying for jobs on linkedin, seeing offers that requested many different technologies. I managed to get a couple of interviews, however, I felt I was put into a school test with questions like: "Whats the difference between an abstract class and an interface", "Whats the difference between a tuple and a list", etc... I mean, if it's necessary I will go through that kind of process, but I had the impression that most jobs would be about working on niche super specific uninteresting parts. After working on many interesting projects, I came to realize that I am able to actually develop useful things!! 😮 And that's very important. I am now in the situation where I highly prioritize a working position where:</p>
                    <ol style="padding-left: 50px; list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>I can learn from my team.</strong></li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>It will have a positive impact in my career.</strong></li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>The work I perform is impactful</strong></li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>I enjoy it</strong></li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>So, if you have read all until now and would like to collaborate with me, don't hesitate to send me a message to <a href="mailto:alvaro.mrgr@gmail.com">alvaro.mrgr@gmail.com</a></p>
