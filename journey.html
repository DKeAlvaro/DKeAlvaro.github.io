                    <p>Completed my Bachelor's degree while working 4 jobs: that was intense and didn't last long, but I really enjoyed and learned from it. This was the end of an era in my life in which I grew a lot as a person.</p>

There is a lot to learn about him, but I would highlight his attitude of believing 'everything is possible'. He created the academy and got it up and running with many schools in less than 7 months. Really inspiring. I would also highlight that during my time there, I noticed I really enjoy teaching and it is definitely a thing I will do in the future</figcaption>
