# End of summer and starting my Master's degree in AI!
I havent written here in a while. It's not that I stopped coding and shipping ðŸ‘€, but more that Linkedin is completely empty during summer. Anyway, I had a GREAT time this summer. I was'nt expecting many cool plans but it ended up being really cool. I would highlight three different trips I did: *Santander*, *Ceuta-Melilla 6 day Bike trip* and *San Fermines*. Each one had their unique bits that made them amazing. Dont worry, I will go more into details about them in the pictures below!

After this recap, I want to write about the plans and expectations I have for the following two years while I'm completing my new degree. 
Here are the things I WOULD like to do/achieve: 
- Complete the degree in the expected time, no extra semester. 
- At least a 8 GPA
- Get a student job in the following month, and stay there for 6-12 months
- Get an internship/qualified job in the second half of 2025 or in 2026
- Go as much as I can to Madrid. I cannot commit to this though cause it depends more on my economic 
I dont have much left to say, just that Im so happy for the opportunity that has been given to me and I hope to be up to expectations!
