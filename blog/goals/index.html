            <h1>My short and long term goals</h1>
            <p>Today is the 26th of February  2025 and I am 21 years old. When I think about what I want to achieve in the long run, I feel my way of thinking has not changed a lot since I was a child. I have always had the same goal:</p>
            <p>Finding a wife whom I can share my life with and create a family. This goes above everything else. In that sense, I have to admit I am very traditional, and I don't doubt it's because of the way I have been raised. Apart from that, I would like to have a stable job where I am comfortable and I enjoy it. </p>
            <p>My parents always gave me the impression that working implies doing something you really hate 8 hours a day 5 days a week and being tied to it 11 months per year. Ideally, I would like to avoid that, and find a job where I have more flexibility to work and take breaks whenever I decide, and especially, a job that I enjoy. Buut, I know that's difficultü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
            <p>In terms of career choices, well, I still don't know what I want to do. I don't even know what I want to do now. What I am currently doing is, just picking something and sticking to it. In my case, now it's data science. I have been working on many projects for the last couple of months and they have been nice, but I am lacking that real world working experience. </p>
            <p>Which leads me to the following point, my short term goals.</p>
            <p>As I said, I'm lacking real life working experience, and what I mean by that, is working with a team that delivers large scale solutions. A team with senior people I can learn from. And that's what I would like to achieve in the next couple of years: learning from people who know more than me. In addition to that, I would like to study a Master's degree. More specifically, I just applied to a 2 year Master's degree in Copenhagen. I would love to get accepted and complete my education there.</p>
