Fuck! Its so hard to write things that are coherent and make sense! I have been writing for over 30 minutes and still don't know how to organize this post. I guess I will improve the more I write.

At the moment I am twenty years old. I was born on October 7, 2003 in Madrid, Spain. I grew up in an upper-middle-class family with my two brothers and my parents. My parents have always been there as well as the rest of my family and I am very grateful and privileged for this reason. When I was 17 years old, I moved to The Netherlands to study a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science & AI. I knew no one there, no friends or family. 

'Why' is a question I often get asked, but to be honest, I don't completely remember. All I know is that my parents gave me the possibility to do study abroad, I did research and found out about this specific programme that mixed some topics I enjoyed during high-school: Math and Programming. When I came here, I had no idea about my future plans. I did not think about what I wanted to do after graduating. 

Last academic year, on June 2024, I should have graduated from my degree. However, due to some missing ECTS I had to postpone my graduation date by a semester, finishing my degree on December 2024. This study delay was not something I was particularly eager about, however, it was not the end of the world. Nevertheless, I had to make a decision: Should I stay in The Netherlands and finish it there? Or should I come back to Spain as I had no strict obligation of staying?

I thought about this dilemma for a while, specifically, for the whole summer. We were reaching the end of August and I still was not sure about what decision to make. It was a big thing for me. On the one hand, I wanted to stay in Spain close to my peers, but on the other hand, I thought I could make more progress in my professional career abroad. I applied to +50 jobs and internships across The Netherlands and Spain and to my surprise, I did not get any jobs in either of them. 

Finally, not entirely knowing why, I decided to come back to The Netherlands. One thing I was sure of is that I did *NOT* want to do nothing. I wanted to fill my time as much as possible working or doing some productive activity. During the first few days after I came back, which happened a week ago, I was completely doubtful about my decision. I had no job, most of my friends had already left and I did not even have a home. My housing contract started the third of september so I had to stay a few days in a friend's house (Thanks Joana lol). What the fuck did I do. Why would I leave all my friends and family for this...

Just a week later (Today!) things have changed a lot, and I am much more motivated. I managed to get four different job interviews I am interested in, from which probably all of them have been sucessful! The first one involves a prescriptive analysis on solar energy panels. The second one is being an informatics teacher to children 5-15 years old, involving simple programming tasks like introduction to python and scratch. The third one is being a sales person in a parking company (lol), and finally, as a cook!

I know the jobs are very different from each other but fuck it, I am twenty years old and I want to try new things. One thing I especially like about this country is the flexibility they offer with the 0 hour contracts. I can work different hours every week, even zero hours, and still be employed, which means I can manage to work in the four jobs at the same time. It probably is not a good idea but I want to see where it goes.

Maybe I should have stayed in Spain and things would have been better, or maybe if I had stayed I would not have gotten any opportunities. But that doesnt matter anymore. What matters is that I am here and I have to work as hard as I can. And by the way, I am planning to visit my friends and family in the end of September.

I will keep you updated.
